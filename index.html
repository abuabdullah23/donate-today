                <h2 class="title-center">Our Donate Plan</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-center">Here is a simple plan for donating to poor people:</p>

                <p class="donate-plan"> Donating can have a positive impact on both the recipient and the donor. By
                    helping those in need, you can make a difference in someone's life and bring joy to your own life as
                    well. </p>

                <!-- 1. Determine the target population: Identify the most vulnerable and in-need communities, such as homeless individuals, low-income families, or refugees.
                <br>
                <br>
                2. Choose an effective donation method: Consider giving money directly to individuals or organizations working to support these communities. Examples include food banks, shelters, and community-based non-profits.
                <br>
                <br>
                3. Set a budget: Decide on an amount you are willing to donate and make it a regular part of your budget. Even small amounts can make a big impact when combined with others.
                <br>
                <br>
                4. Make the donation: Give your donation directly to individuals or organizations working to support the target population, either through online transfers, check, or in-person donations.
                <br>
                <br>
                5. Keep track of your impact: Keep receipts and records of your donations so you can see the impact you are making and continue to support the cause in the future.
                <br>
                <br>
                6. Spread awareness: Share your experience and encourage others to donate by sharing information about the organizations and individuals you support.
